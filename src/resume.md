## Overview 

As a polyglot web application developer, I have had the opportunity to work in a
large number of languages on many platforms.  I love the dynamic languages and
Unix-like environments where I've grown and cut my teeth.  Even after all these
years in the industry, I'm still excited by the possibilities of the web, where
I feel there is plenty of space yet to be explored.

As a Director and Development Manager I lead and grew large cross-functional
teams of engineers and developers in the Financial and Healthcare sectors.
I found success leading teams to greater efficiency while rapidly growing the
depth and breadth of skills across the team.  I reduced turnover on my teams
by focusing on team identity and encouraging every team member to participate
and to own our shared narrative.

Whether as a manager or as a senior contributor, I make teams better.
