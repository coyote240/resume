## Overview 

With over 20 years of experience developing applications for the web, I have had
the opportunity to work across a large number of problem domains in numerous
languages, platforms and frameworks. I focus on building stable and secure
systems while growing and cultivating the teams required to maintain them. I
work to anticipate project and product needs and translate them into software
that serves those needs today while being flexible enough to adapt to the needs
of tomorrow.

As a Director and Development Manager I have lead and grown large
cross-functional teams of engineers and developers in the Financial and
Healthcare sectors.  I found success leading teams to greater efficiency while
rapidly growing the depth and breadth of skills across the team.  I reduced
turnover on my teams by focusing on team identity and encouraging every team
member to participate and to own our shared narrative.

Whether as a manager or as a senior contributor, I make teams better.

As a penetration tester it is my responsibilty to not only discover flaws in a
