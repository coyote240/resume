## Overview 

With over 20 years of experience developing applications for the web, I have had
the opportunity to work across a large number of problem domains in numerous
languages, platforms and frameworks. I focus on building stable and secure
systems while growing and cultivating the teams required to maintain them. I
work to anticipate project and product needs and translate them into software
that serves those needs today while being flexible enough to adapt to the needs
of tomorrow.

As a Director and Development Manager I have lead and grown large,
cross-functional teams of engineers and developers across multiple domains.  I
found success leading teams to greater efficiency while rapidly growing the
depth and breadth of skills across each team.  I reduced turnover on my teams by
focusing on team identity and encouraging every team member to participate and
to own our shared narrative.

Whether as a manager or as a senior contributor, I make teams better.

## Certification
